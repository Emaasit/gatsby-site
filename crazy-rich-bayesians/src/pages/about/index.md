**Crazy Rich Bayesians** is the personal blog of **Daniel Emaasit**. <font size="4">*This blog's name is inspired by the title of the Hollywood movie [**Crazy Rich Asians**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Rich_Asians_(film)).Get it...? It rhymes.*</font> :joy:

I am a Data Scientist at [Haystax](https://www.haystax.com/) in Washington, D.C. My interests involve developing principled [probabilistic models](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) for problems where training data are scarce by leveraging knowledge from subject-matter experts and context information. In particular, I am interested in [flexible probabilistic machine learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) methods, such as Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and data-efficient learning methods such as [Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2599) & [Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06491).

I am the creator of [Pymc-learn](https://www.pymc-learn.org/), a library for practical probabilistic machine learning in Python.

I am also a Ph.D. Candidate of Transportation Engineering at [UNLV](http://www.unlv.edu/) where my research in [nonparametric Bayesian](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) methods is focused on developing flexible-statistical models for traveler-behavior analytics.
